        <h1>Analysis of Seat allotment by institute over the years</h1>
        <img class="seatanalysis" src="seatallotmentbyinstitute.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p>From the above graph, we can say that IIT Kharagpur has a high number of seat allotments, indicating its popularity among candidates and the availability of a diverse range of programs, branches, and a large campus area that can accommodate a large population of students. Following IIT Kharagpur, the colleges based on seat allotment are IIT Varanasi (BHU), IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Roorkee, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, ISM Dhanbad, IIT Bhubaneswar, and IIT Guwahati.
        </p>
        <p>The variation in seat allotment can be due to several factors. Some institutes maintain constant popularity among candidates over the years, leading to high demand for their programs. Additionally, institutes often have various seat quotas such as the All India Quota (AIQ), State Quota, and different reserved category quotas. Seat allotments for these additional quotas may fluctuate based on candidates' preferences and eligibility. Furthermore, seat allotment numbers can also depend on the demand for specific programs within the institutes. Popular programs may see more seat allotments, while less popular ones may have fewer.
