        <h1>Analysis of Seat allotment per Round</h1>
        <img class="seatanalysis" src="roundwiseanalysis.PNG" alt="Image Description">
        <p>From the above graph, the number of seats allotted gradually decreases from Round 1 to Round 2, 
            indicating that many seats were filled in the first two rounds. This may be because candidates' 
            preferences for well-known institutes and programs in the preliminary rounds may have increased 
            the number of seat allocations. As the rounds progress, fewer seats become available in these well-liked 
            options, which leads to a reduction in seat allotments.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast, the seat allotments in Rounds 3, 4, 5, and 6 are nearly equal, with approximately 14,000 seats allotted in each round. This suggests that there is a consistent number of remaining vacant seats available for allocation. Candidates who didn't receive their first preferences in the first round may decide to wait for further rounds to see if they can secure places in more desirable programs or institutes. This may result in a steady distribution of seats in Rounds 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
        <p>The demand from candidates is also relatively stable during these rounds. Round 7 shows a comparatively lower number of seat allotments, indicating that by this stage of the counseling process, most seats have been filled, and only a few vacant seats remain.</p>
