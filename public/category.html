        <h1>Analysis of Category wise seat allotment</h1>
        <img class="seatanalysis" src="cateogarywiseseatallotment.PNG" alt="Image Description">
        <p>From the above graph, the highest number of seat allotments is in the open category, which includes candidates without any specific reservations. The OBC-NCL, SC, ST, and EWS categories have slightly fewer seat allotments than the open category. These categories have specific reservations, which ensure a certain percentage of seats are allotted to candidates from these categories. Compared to the general and reserved categories, the seat allocations for applicants in the PWD group are comparatively smaller. Seat allocations from the open category to the reserved categories are declining, reflecting the goal of using reservations to give chances and representation to candidates from underprivileged or marginalized backgrounds. The EWS category, introduced recently, has seen many seat allotments and aims to provide opportunities to candidates from economically weaker sections of society.
